        <h2>Tim Burton</h2>
        <h4>
        Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, the son of Jean Burton (née Erickson, 1933–2002), later the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, 
        and William "Bill" Burton (1930–2000), a former minor league baseball player who was working for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department.[4][5] 
        As a preteen, Burton would make short films in his backyard at 2101 North Evergreen Street using crude stop motion animation techniques or shooting on 8 mm 
        film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is The Island of Doctor Agor, which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Burbank 
        High School but was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure 
        in artwork, painting, drawing, and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl.[6] 
        After graduating from Burbank High School, Burton attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita, to study character animation.[7] 
        As a student at CalArts, Burton made the shorts Stalk of the Celery Monster and King and Octopus.[8]
