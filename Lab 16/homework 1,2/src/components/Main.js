        <h4>
        Timothy Walter Burton[a] (born August 25, 1958) is an American filmmaker and animator. 
        He is known for his gothic fantasy and horror films such as Beetlejuice (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990), 
        The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) 
        and Dark Shadows (2012), as well as the television series Wednesday (2022). Burton also directed the superhero films Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992),
        the sci-fi film Planet of the Apes (2001), the fantasy-drama Big Fish (2003), the musical adventure film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), 
        and the fantasy films Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016).
        Burton has often worked with actors Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp, Lisa Marie (former girlfriend), Helena Bonham Carter (his former domestic partner) and 
        composer Danny Elfman, who made scores for all but three of Burton's films. Burton also wrote and illustrated the poetry book The Melancholy Death of 
        Oyster Boy & Other Stories, published in 1997 by British publishing house Faber and Faber, and a compilation of his drawings, sketches, and other artwork, 
        entitled The Art of Tim Burton, was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar, 
        containing sketches made by Burton on napkins at bars and restaurants he visited, was released in 2015. His accolades include nominations for two Academy 
        Awards and three BAFTA Awards, and wins for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award.
